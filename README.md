## Loyalty Plant hackathon app

The project is essentially a game where you are being assigned to a team of players with whom you are supposed to get over a number of 'game stations' filled with various tasks. For a successful completion of a task you get an award - points. Later you can 'buy' some food and drinks in a bar redeeming those points. To redeem your reward you should show a QR-code from your smartphone (withing the App) to a special scanning device. Then points from your account are being debited and you get your reward!
